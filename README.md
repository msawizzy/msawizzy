# Hi there :wave:, _I am **Temitope.**_

I use tech as a practical tool to help people _especially small business owners_ understand and improve the way they work.
I care about digital literacy, not just as a skill but as a foundation for growth, access, and better decision-making.
Most of my work sits at the intersection of learning, data, and real-world application. 
From spreadsheets and automations to training programs and workflow improvements, I focus on simple systems that work.

Currently building tools, training, and communities with Rhemapath.
Open to collaborations that help more people build confidence with digital tools.

I use MySql, Excel, PowerBI and Google Sheets.

You can view my [portfolio](https://www.datascienceportfol.io/temitopeomodojo "Temitope's Portfolio") to see some of the projects that I have worked on.
